       FOREST
    </h1>
<ul>

    <li>
    <p> The word forest is commonly used, there is no universally recognised precise definition, with more than 800 definitions of forest used around the world.[4] Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of trees, under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees in the past, will grow trees in the future,[12] or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation type.[13][14]</p>

   <p> There are three broad categories of definitions of forest in use: administrative, land use, and land cover.[13] Administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land, and commonly bear little relationship to its vegetation: land that is legally designated as a forest is defined as such even if no trees are growing on it.[13] Land-use definitions are based on the primary purpose that the land serves. For example, a forest may be defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a land-use definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry—or areas that have been cleared by harvesting, disease, or fire—are still considered forests, even if they contain no trees. Land-cover definitions define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are typically the number of trees per area (density), the area of ground under the tree canopy (canopy cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area).[13] Under such land-cover definitions, an area of land can only be known as forest if it is growing trees. Areas that fail to meet the land-cover definition may be still included while immature trees are present that are expected to meet the definition at maturity.[13]</p>
    
   <p> Under land-use definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest, woodland, and savanna. Under some definitions, to be considered a forest requires very high levels of tree canopy cover, from 60% to 100%,[15] which excludes woodlands and savannas, which have a lower canopy cover. Other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest, and include all areas with tree canopies over 10%.[12]
   </p>
  <p>  Some areas covered with trees are legally defined as agricultural areas, e.g. Norway spruce plantations, under Austrian forest law, when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and are below a certain height.

        Tropical Forest
    </h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Tropical forests also refer to tropical rainforests, with continuous rainfall throughout the year. These include evergreen, seasonal, cloud forests, tropical and subtropical. The tropical forests are situated in a broad zone outside the equator. Globally these forests are found near the southern parts of Asia’s West coast of India. Other tropical rainforest places include Eastern Madagascar, New Guinea, the West coast of India, Assam, Australia, the Zaire basin, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands.

    2.Temperature Forest

<ul>
    <li>
<p>
    The air is still as you wander through the trees. Leaves slide under your feet and thick tree trunks surround you. Above your head everything is green, as leaves block the sky. You feel twigs crunch under your feet, and mushrooms peek out from under beds of leaves. Somewhere off in the trees you hear the pecking of a woodpecker. All sorts of birds call or fly off as you walk by. You stay quiet and see a deer pass by in the distance. Chances are, you’re in a temperate forest.
</p>
    </li>

    <p>
    Even if you've spent time in temperate forests, these ecosystems hold many plants and animals that you've likely never seen. In parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, temperate forests used to cover huge areas of land. In several places they still cover large areas, though we've cut down most of the old growth forests.</p>

    3.Sub Tropical Forest
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
<p>
    Subtropical rainforests are found on the east coasts of North America and Asia, in addition to some mountainous semi-tropical regions and parts of Oceania. The regions in which they exist have hot summers with abundant rainfall, similar to the year-round climate of a tropical rainforest, but which transition in winter to colder temperate climates with moderate rainfall.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>

    Subtropical rainforests have a lot in common with tropical rainforests, and in places like Florida, a state in the United States where subtropical rainforests dominate, you can find palm trees; however, as you go north from Florida into the state of Georgia, the plants start to look more like what you would find in a temperate forest. However, the density of subtropical rainforests and tropical forests mark them out; in temperate forests, most of the vegetation is in the form of trees, and there is not thick vegetation along the ground level. Meanwhile, subtropical forests tend to have thick vegetation that extends to a couple feet above the ground, making navigation through the forest difficult.
    
</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
    These forests are not to be confused with the temperate rainforests encountered on the West Coast of the United States, which feature mild summers and cool to cold winters, with precipitation significantly higher in winter than in summer.
